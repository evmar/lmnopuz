== Requirements
apt-get install ruby1.8 libamrita-ruby1.8
gem install mongrel
gem install json

== Usage
./server --help

== Running lmnopuz on your own server
Two ways:
1) Just run it on some random port and tell your friends about that port.
2) Or, use reverse proxying to "hook in" the server to a directory on
your existing site.  Here's how to do it with Apache's mod_proxy:
  ProxyRequests off
  <Proxy *>
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
  </Proxy>
  # proxy requests to the crossword server...
  # and rewrite its responses to the right address
  ProxyPass        /software/lmnopuz/demo/ http://localhost:2000/
  ProxyPassReverse /software/lmnopuz/demo/ http://localhost:2000/
You can then bring up the server with the --localhost flag and your server
won't publish port 2000 to the world.
